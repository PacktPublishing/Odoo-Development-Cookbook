#Odoo Development Cookbook

This code is targeted at Python developers who want to learn Odoo development or consolidate their Odoo skills. Some experience with the JavaScript programming language and web development in general is required to fully benefit from the frontend chapters.

This code focuses on core application development. It does not cover how to use the business applications provided by Odoo. You may want to refer to Working with Odoo, by Greg Moss, for this.

To understand this, you will have to read the source code and experiment for yourself. Being familiar with the contents of the [Odoo Development Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/odoo-development-cookbook) should make your life easier, as it contains pointers to parts of the code you can read to learn about a specific topic.
